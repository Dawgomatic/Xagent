##  Integration

### With ClawdBot Trading Skill

PolymarketAuth is designed to work seamlessly with the [Polymarket + Hyperliquid Trading Skill](https://github.com/yourusername/polymarket-hyperliquid-skill).

**Setup:**
1. Run PolymarketAuth.exe
2. Install the ClawdBot skill
3. Start trading with `/trade` commands

### With Custom Applications

PolymarketAuth exposes a local REST API on `localhost:8080`:

**Example Request:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/markets', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/markets` - List available markets
- `POST /api/orders` - Place order
- `GET /api/positions` - Get current positions
- `GET /api/balance` - Get account balance
- `GET /api/status` - Check auth service status

---

##  Security

### Credential Protection

-  Credentials encrypted at rest using AES-256
-  Keys never transmitted in plaintext
-  Local-only service (no external connections except Polymarket API)
-  Automatic credential rotation support

### Best Practices

1. **Never share your API credentials**
2. **Use API keys with minimal required permissions**
3. **Enable 2FA on your Polymarket account**
4. **Regularly rotate API keys**
5. **Run PolymarketAuth only on trusted machines**
6. **Keep Windows Defender/antivirus enabled**

### Firewall Configuration

PolymarketAuth only needs:
- **Outbound:** HTTPS (443) to Polymarket API
- **Inbound:** localhost:8080 (local only)

---

##  Monitoring

### Status Indicators

The application displays real-time status:

```
 Connected    - Authentication active, ready for requests
 Connecting   - Establishing connection to Polymarket
 Disconnected - Connection lost, retrying...
 Idle         - No active requests
```

### Logs

Logs are written to:
```
%APPDATA%\PolymarketAuth\logs\
```

**Log Levels:**
- `INFO` - Normal operations
- `WARN` - Non-critical issues
- `ERROR` - Critical errors requiring attention

---

##  Troubleshooting

###  "Failed to start authentication service"

**Cause:** Port 8080 already in use

**Solution:**
```cmd
# Check what's using port 8080
netstat -ano | findstr :8080

# Kill the process or change PolymarketAuth port in config
```

###  "Invalid API credentials"

**Cause:** Incorrect API key, secret, or passphrase

**Solution:**
1. Verify credentials in Polymarket dashboard
2. Delete `%APPDATA%\PolymarketAuth\config.dat`
3. Restart PolymarketAuth.exe and re-enter credentials

###  "Connection timeout"

**Cause:** Network connectivity issues or firewall blocking

**Solution:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify firewall allows PolymarketAuth.exe
3. Try disabling VPN temporarily
4. Check Polymarket API status

###  ".NET Framework not found"

**Cause:** Missing .NET Framework 4.8

**Solution:**
Download and install [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
