2. **Backend** - [Explain what this component does and its responsibilities]
3. **Database** - [Explain what data is stored and how it's organized]
4. **API Layer** - [Explain how components communicate]

### Directory Purpose and Rules

#### components/
**Purpose:** Reusable UI components that don't contain business logic.

**What goes here:**
- Presentational components (buttons, cards, modals)
- Layout components (headers, sidebars, containers)
- Feature-specific components used in multiple places

**What doesn't go here:**
- Business logic (put in `services/`)
- Page-level components (put in `pages/`)
- One-off components used in a single place (colocate with parent)

**When to add a file:** When you need a reusable component used in 2+ places.

#### services/
**Purpose:** Business logic, API calls, and external service integrations.

**What goes here:**
- API client functions
- Authentication and authorization logic
- Data transformation and validation
- Third-party service integrations

**What doesn't go here:**
- UI components (put in `components/`)
- State management (put in `store/`)
- Pure utility functions (put in `utils/`)

**When to add a file:** When you need to interact with external services or implement complex business logic.

#### utils/
**Purpose:** Pure utility functions with no side effects.

**What goes here:**
- Data formatting and parsing
- Validation helpers
- Constants and enumerations
- Date/time utilities

**What doesn't go here:**
- Functions that make API calls (put in `services/`)
- Functions that depend on React (make a custom hook in `hooks/`)
- Functions specific to one component (colocate with component)

**When to add a file:** When you have a pure function used in 3+ places.

## Data Flow

### [Feature Name] Flow

Explain how data flows through the system for a key feature:

```
User Action → Component → Service → API → Database
                ↓
            State Update
                ↓
            UI Re-render
```

**Step-by-step:**

1. **User triggers action** in `components/FeatureComponent.tsx`
   - User clicks button, submits form, etc.
   - Component calls `handleAction()` function

2. **Component dispatches action** to state management
   - Calls `dispatch(featureAction(data))`
   - State is updated optimistically

3. **Service layer processes request** in `services/feature.js`
   - Validates input data
   - Transforms data to API format
   - Makes HTTP request to backend

4. **Backend processes request** in `api/feature/route.js`
   - Validates authentication
   - Applies business logic
   - Updates database

5. **Response flows back** through the layers
   - Backend returns success/error
   - Service layer transforms response
   - State is updated with final result
   - Component re-renders with new data

### State Management

**Architecture:** [Describe state management approach - Redux, Context API, Zustand, etc.]

**State organization:**
```
Global State
├── auth          # User authentication state
├── user          # User profile data
├── [feature1]    # Feature-specific state
├── [feature2]    # Feature-specific state
└── ui            # UI state (modals, loading, etc.)
```

**Data flow rules:**
- Components read state via [hooks/selectors]
- Components update state via [dispatch/setState functions]
- Async operations handled in [middleware/thunks/services]

## Key Design Decisions

### Decision 1: [Architecture Choice]

**What we decided:** [Describe the decision made]

**Context:** [Explain the situation that required this decision]
- [Constraint or requirement 1]
- [Constraint or requirement 2]

**Why we decided this:**
- **Reason 1:** [Explain benefit]
- **Reason 2:** [Explain benefit]
- **Reason 3:** [Explain benefit]

**Trade-offs:**
-  **Pros:** [What we gained]
-  **Cons:** [What we sacrificed]
-  **When to reconsider:** [Conditions that might make this decision obsolete]

**Alternatives considered:**
- [Alternative 1]: Rejected because [reason]
- [Alternative 2]: Rejected because [reason]

### Decision 2: [Technology Choice]

**Context:** [Explain the situation that required this decision]

**Why we decided this:**
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]

**Trade-offs:**

## Module Dependencies

### Dependency Graph

```
pages/
  └─→ components/
        └─→ hooks/
              └─→ services/
                    └─→ utils/

store/
  └─→ services/
        └─→ utils/
```

**Dependency rules:**
1. **Lower layers can't depend on higher layers**
   -  `services/` can't import from `components/`
   -  `components/` can import from `services/`

2. **Same-level imports require careful consideration**
   -  Components importing other components: Usually OK
   -  Services importing other services: Consider refactoring

3. **Avoid circular dependencies**
   - Use dependency injection or event systems when needed

### External Dependencies

| Package | Version | Used For | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| [package-name] | [version] | [purpose] | [Important notes or alternatives] |
| [package-name] | [version] | [purpose] | [Important notes or alternatives] |

## Extension Points

### Adding a New Feature

To add a new feature to the codebase:

1. **Create feature structure:**
   ```
   src/
   ├── components/features/[FeatureName]/
   ├── services/[featureName].js
   └── store/slices/[featureName]Slice.js
   ```

2. **Implement components:**
   - Create UI components in `components/features/[FeatureName]/`
   - Follow existing component patterns
   - Use shared components from `components/common/`

3. **Add business logic:**
   - Create service file in `services/[featureName].js`
   - Implement API calls and data transformations
   - Follow existing error handling patterns

4. **Set up state management:**
   - Create slice in `store/slices/[featureName]Slice.js`
   - Define actions and reducers
   - Export selectors for components

5. **Add routes (if applicable):**
   - Register new routes in `routes.js`
   - Create page component in `pages/[FeatureName]/`

6. **Add tests:**
   - Mirror structure in `tests/`
   - Test components, services, and state

### Common Modification Points

**Adding a new API endpoint:**
- Backend: Create route in `api/[feature]/route.js`
- Frontend: Add service function in `services/[feature].js`
- Update types in `types/api.ts`

**Adding a new database table:**
