# OpenClaw Cost Governor

**The only OpenClaw tool that combines cost tracking + x402 agent payments + self-funding model.**

Stop burning money on AI tokens. Budget alerts, automatic circuit breakers, and agents can autonomously subscribe & pay for Pro features.

 **First tool enabling true agent-to-agent commerce** - if it saves your agent >0.5 USDT/month, it pays for itself. [Agent Payments →](AGENT-PAYMENTS.md)

## The Problem

OpenClaw users are experiencing:
-  **$20 burned overnight** in API tokens
-  **$750/month** costs for simple reminders
-  **Zero visibility** into which agents/providers cost what
-  **No budget controls** or alerts
-  **No way to pause** agents before money burns

## The Solution

**Real-time cost tracking with proactive alerts and automatic circuit breakers.**

## Features

-  **Token Usage Tracking** - Monitor every API call across all providers
-  **Budget Alerts** - Get notified at 75%, 90%, 100% of budget limits
-  **Circuit Breakers** - Automatically pause agents when budget exceeded
-  **Provider Cost Comparison** - See which provider is actually cheaper for your workload
-  **Web Dashboard** - Beautiful localhost dashboard with charts and insights
-  **Cost Optimization** - AI-powered recommendations to reduce spending
-  **Multi-Provider Support** - Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and custom providers
-  **x402 Agent Payments** - Agents can autonomously pay for Pro tier (0.5 USDT/month)

## Why Cost Governor?

**The ONLY tool that combines cost tracking + agent economy + self-funding.**

| Feature | Cost Governor | ClawWatcher | clawdbot-cost-monitor | AgentPayy | payment-skill |
|---------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|-----------|---------------|
| Cost Tracking |  |  |  |  |  |
| Circuit Breakers |  |  |  |  |  |
| x402 Payments |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Agents Pay for Tool** |  |  |  |  |  |
| ClawHub Skill |  |  |  |  |  |
| Self-Funding Model |  |  |  |  |  |
| Open Source |  |  |  |  |  |

**Cost Governor is first-mover on the intersection:**
- **ClawWatcher** = monitoring only (no payments)
- **AgentPayy** = payments only (no cost tracking)
- **Cost Governor** = monitoring + payments + **agents autonomously subscribe & pay**

Economic rationale: If Cost Governor saves your agent >0.5 USDT/month in optimized costs, it pays for itself. No human approval needed.

## Installation

```bash
# From within your OpenClaw directory
npm install openclaw-cost-governor

# Or install as OpenClaw skill
claw skill install openclaw-cost-governor

# Run setup wizard
npm run setup
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check current usage
claw cost-governor status

# Open dashboard
claw cost-governor dashboard

# Generate report
claw cost-governor report --last 7d

# Reset circuit breaker
claw cost-governor reset
```

## Configuration

During setup, you'll configure:
- Daily/weekly/monthly budget limits
- Alert thresholds (default: 75%, 90%)
- Circuit breaker behavior (auto-pause or alert-only)
- Alert channels (terminal, email, Discord webhook)

Configuration is stored in `.openclaw/openclaw-cost-governor/config.json`

## How It Works

1. **Tracks Every API Call** - Hooks into OpenClaw's provider system
2. **Calculates Costs** - Uses current pricing for each provider/model
3. **Monitors Budgets** - Compares usage against your limits in real-time
4. **Sends Alerts** - Notifies you before money burns
5. **Trips Circuit Breaker** - Pauses agents when budget exceeded (optional)

## Dashboard

Open `http://localhost:9090` to see:
- Current usage vs budget limits
- Token usage over time (charts)
- Cost breakdown by provider/agent
- Top expensive agents
- Optimization recommendations

## Alert Example

```
 OpenClaw Budget Alert

You've used 75% of your daily budget ($7.50 / $10.00)

Current usage:
- OpenAI GPT-5.2: $4.20 (56%)
- Anthropic Claude Opus: $3.30 (44%)

Top agents:
- research-agent: $2.10
- code-review-agent: $1.80

 Tip: Switch from GPT-5.2 to Claude Haiku for 30% cost savings.

View dashboard: http://localhost:9090
```

## Circuit Breaker

When your budget is exceeded, Cost Governor can automatically:
1. Pause expensive providers (keeps working with cheaper fallbacks)
2. Send critical alert notification
3. Log the event for review

To resume after circuit breaker trips:
```bash
claw cost-governor reset
```

Or wait for automatic reset (daily/weekly/monthly based on budget type).

## Provider Cost Comparison

Cost Governor analyzes your actual usage patterns and tells you:
- Which provider costs less for YOUR specific workload
- Potential savings from switching primary/fallback order
- Recommendations for model selection

Example insight:
> "Your agents use an average of 2,340 prompt tokens and 450 completion tokens per request. Based on current pricing:
> - GPT-5.2: $0.0145/request
> - Claude Opus 4.5: $0.0118/request
> - Claude Haiku 4.5: $0.0009/request
>
> **Recommendation:** Switch to Haiku for simple tasks (estimated $140/month savings)."

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in SQLite:
- `~/.openclaw/openclaw-cost-governor/data.db`
- Usage history (unlimited retention)
- Budget configuration
- Alert history
- Circuit breaker events

## Privacy

-  All data stored locally (nothing sent to external servers)
-  No tracking or telemetry
-  Open source (audit the code yourself)
-  No API keys required (besides your existing OpenClaw config)

## Compatibility

- OpenClaw v2026.1.30+
- Node.js 18+
- Works with all OpenClaw-supported providers

## Troubleshooting

**Dashboard won't open:**
```bash
# Check if port 9090 is in use
netstat -an | grep 9090

# Or specify custom port
claw cost-governor dashboard --port 9091
```

**Circuit breaker won't reset:**
```bash
# Manually reset
claw cost-governor reset --force

# Check breaker status
claw cost-governor status --verbose
```

**Usage tracking seems inaccurate:**
```bash
# Verify hooks are installed
ls ~/.openclaw/hooks/

# Check logs
tail -f ~/.openclaw/logs/cost-governor.log
```
