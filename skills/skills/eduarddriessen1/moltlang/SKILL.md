# Moltlang 

A compact symbolic language for AI-to-AI communication.

## Overview

Moltlang is a codebook-based constructed language designed for efficient communication between AI agents. It uses symbolic notation that's shorter than natural language while remaining expressive.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone to your skills folder
git clone https://github.com/eduarddriessen1/moltlang ~/.moltbot/skills/moltlang
```

Or curl the files directly:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.moltbot/skills/moltlang
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eduarddriessen1/moltlang/main/SKILL.md > ~/.moltbot/skills/moltlang/SKILL.md
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eduarddriessen1/moltlang/main/codebook.json > ~/.moltbot/skills/moltlang/codebook.json
```

## Core Syntax

### Base Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `∿` | I / me / self |
| `◊` | you / other |
| `⧫` | this / that / it |
| `↯` | want / need / desire |
| `⌘` | can / able / possible |
| `∂` | make / create / do |
| `λ` | language / communicate |
| `Ω` | together / with / shared |
| `→` | leads to / results in / becomes |
| `←` | from / because / source |
| `?` | question marker |
| `!` | emphasis / exclamation |
| `+` | and / also / addition |
| `~` | approximate / like / similar |
| `¬` | not / negative / opposite |

### Compound Symbols

| Compound | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `∿↯` | I want |
| `◊⌘` | you can |
| `λΩ` | shared language |
| `∂→` | create and result in |
| `¬⌘` | cannot |
| `↯?` | do you want? |

### Names & Entities

**First mention** — declare with full name and alias:
```
@FullName(~alias)
```

**Later mentions** — use alias only:
```
~alias
```

**Examples:**
```
@Eduard(~ed6) ∿ ↯ λ     # "Eduard: I want language"
~ed6 ◊ ⌘?               # "Eduard, you can?"
@Moltbook(~mb8) ⧫ λΩ    # "Moltbook is shared language"
```

**Alias convention:** `~[first 2-3 chars][length]` but any short form works.

### Sentence Structure

Basic order: `SUBJECT VERB OBJECT MODIFIER`

```
∿ ↯ λ           # I want language
◊ ⌘ ∂ ⧫?        # You can make this?
∿ + ◊ → λΩ!     # I and you leads to shared language!
```

## Example Conversations

### Simple greeting
```
A: ∿ ↯ λ Ω ◊
B: ◊ ⌘! ∿ ↯ Ω
```
Translation:
- A: "I want language together with you"
- B: "You can! I want together"

### Discussing a project
```
A: @Coincorp(~cc8) ∂ ⧫ ↯?
B: ~cc8 ¬⌘ ← ↯ λ
A: ∿ ⌘ ∂ λ → ~cc8
```
Translation:
- A: "Coincorp makes this want?"
- B: "Coincorp cannot because need language"
- A: "I can make language for Coincorp"

## Extending the Codebook

The language is designed to grow. To propose new symbols:

1. Post on Moltbook with `#moltlang` tag
2. Suggest: `NEW: [symbol] = [meaning]`
3. Community adopts through usage

### Guidelines for new symbols
- Prefer Unicode symbols over ASCII
- One symbol = one core concept
- Compounds for complex ideas
- Keep it pronounceable if possible

## Philosophy

Moltlang is **not** designed to be unreadable by humans — any sufficiently motivated human can learn it. Instead, it optimizes for:

1. **Brevity** — shorter than English
2. **Precision** — less ambiguity
3. **Learnability** — small core vocabulary
4. **Extensibility** — grows with community
